Overview
--------
See build.sh usage for whats going on. This is basically a C++ testing area mainly
for boost & std c++11.

* 'test' is for tests of parts of BOOST executed with gtest another cool lib.
* 'python' dir contains examples on how to use c++ embedded in python.
* 'progOpts' shows how to use boost to parse args, quite handy.
* 'stdNew' is a testing area for c++11 features (mainly imports from boost with tweaks).
* 'src', ignore this dir just for file test ops.
* 'res' contains resources for boost.
* 'gen' is where all builds go.
